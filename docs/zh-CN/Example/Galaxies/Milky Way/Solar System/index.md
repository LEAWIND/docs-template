## Solar System

The Solar System is a celestial system consisting of the Sun, eight planets, their moons, dwarf planets, asteroids, comets, and other celestial bodies. Located in the outer edge of the Milky Way galaxy's Orion Arm, the Solar System formed from a collapsing molecular cloud around 4.6 billion years ago. The Sun, a G-type main-sequence star, lies at the center of the Solar System, with all the other bodies held in orbit by its gravitational pull.
The eight planets in the Solar System, in order from the Sun, are:

1. Mercury
1. Venus
1. Earth
1. Mars
1. Jupiter
1. Saturn
1. Uranus
1. Neptune

In addition to these planets, the Solar System includes five dwarf planets: Pluto, Ceres, Eris, Haumea, and Makemake. There are also numerous asteroids, comets, and other small bodies, many of which are located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, and the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud beyond Neptune.
The Solar System provides a unique laboratory for studying the formation and evolution of planetary systems, and ongoing space missions continue to expand our knowledge of these celestial bodies.
