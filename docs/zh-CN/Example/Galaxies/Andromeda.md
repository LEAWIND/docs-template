# Andromeda Galaxy (M31)

Also known as the Andromeda Nebula, the Andromeda Galaxy is the nearest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way and is the largest galaxy in the Local Group. It is located about 2.537 million light-years from Earth and is visible to the naked eye as a fuzzy blob in the constellation Andromeda. Andromeda is similar in structure to the Milky Way and is expected to collide with our galaxy in about 4.5 billion years, eventually merging to form a single elliptical galaxy.
